title: Padding
---

Use the [`pad` attribute](/attributes/#pad) to customize the padding (in pixels) around a diagram.

````md title="src/content/docs/example.md" "pad=10"
```d2 pad=10
Content -> Website: Astro
```
````

The above code block will be rendered as the following diagram with a smaller padding compared to the default (100 pixels):

```d2 pad=10
Content -> Website: Astro
```
