title: Why D2?
description: Learn why D2 is an excellent choice for creating diagrams.

[**D2**](https://d2lang.com/) is a modern language that turns text to diagrams. It stands for _Declarative Diagramming_.

One of the main advantages of D2 is that its main objective is to output diagrams that are meant to be viewed in a web context. To achieve this, D2 outputs SVG by default which contains the diagram and its associated CSS styles. No client-side JavaScript is required to render the diagrams, even animated ones.

## Features

D2 also includes a lot of powerful features out of the box, such as:
